## Foundations of Flint

Flint was created because of a dream to make the world a better place. To make lives better! From those struggling to get adequate healthcare to the nurses working two jobs in Nigeria. We believe that everyone has the right to:

- [Quality health care](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-rights-and-health)
  (**World Health Organization:** *Human Rights and Health*)
- [Emigration](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights)
  (**United Nations:** *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* - Article 13)
- [Equal opportunities](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/)
  (**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy:** *Equality of Opportunity*)

## Our Solution

In America we are over 1 million nurses short. To provide **quality health care** in the US we need more domestic nurses. There are many incredible and capable nurses around the world who are looking to advance their career. We make this possible by connecting them with healthcare organizations and managing the complexity of licensing and immigration. We believe that everyone should be able to make the choice to **emigrate**. This is what the American dream is all about! We designed an experience for internationally educated nurses to come to America to work. No matter your economic status, if you have the skills you now have the opportunity. This is how we help create **equal opportunities** for nurses everywhere!
