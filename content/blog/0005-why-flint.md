Why Flint
Flint was born from a dream to help people live better lives. We believe that everyone has the right to emigrate, equal opportunities, and quality health care. These are the three tenets of our product. We create an experience for Internationally Educated Nurses to come to America to work while making better lives for themselves and their families.

## Our Idea is founded in Human Rights
Flint was born from a dream to help people live better lives. We believe that everyone has the [right to emigrate](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), [equal opportunities](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/equal-opportunity/), and [quality health care](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-rights-and-health). These are the three tenets of our product, with which we want to promote the right to freedom of movement, equal opportunity and access to quality healthcare. We create an experience for Internationally Educated Nurses to come to America to work while making better lives for themselves and their families.

## Challenges
For nurses to relocate to America, they need to pass the NCLEX, demonstrate a professional level of English, and file for a nurse license and immigration, which requires an employment offer. It is very difficult to do these tasks and study for examinations, often while working full-time and supporting a family. Furthermore, the procedures and relocating costs require an exorbitant amount of funds that is often equivalent to 10 years of more of savings. This situation creates large inequality in terms of opportunity for nurses worldwide that dream of moving to the United States.

## Partnerships
Flint makes partnerships with American health care providers to make it possible to finance relocation associated costs and employment opportunities to level the playing field for international nurses. We believe that these strategic partnerships are key to promoting equal opportunities.

## Alignment and Motivations
We think that in addition to creating opportunities for international nurses, we need to have a deep alignment in motivation both form the nurse and from the industry. Therefore Flint offers the most flexible terms for the nurse without the typical penalties associated with placement agency contracts. Moreover, the nurse gets to choose where they will live and work. Again, we also depart from the placement agency standard by having each nurse interview multiple of our partners and choose which employment offer to accept. It typically includes matching the nurses' preferences in the type of unit (ICU, Peds, MedSurge, etc.), the location (city, states, etc.), and community, such as the presence of ethnic support community and relevant employment and schools for their families. Because the nurse shortage is across America, there are opportunities for relief everywhere.

## Education
To be successful, the nurses need not only to prepare for the English and NCLEX examination but also to integrate the American way of nursing. That is why Flint focuses on education and why we offer stipends to nurses so that they can take the time to learn while keeping their commitment to their families. Our education program includes English as needed, NCLEX training, and learning about American nursing and how nursing teams work together in America; modules focus on etiquette, industry jargon, and local tradition. Because being an excellent nurse in America is also communicating, and we care that our nurses are ready.

In summary, Flint offers nurses the opportunity to exercise their fundamental rights while offering them the education for success so that they may come to America and relief our ongoing nursing shortage.
