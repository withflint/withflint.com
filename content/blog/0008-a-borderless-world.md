## Flint Launches A New English Program to Help Nurses Worldwide.

*San Francisco—November 2022—*Flint launches a new English training program to help nurses worldwide to start their careers in the U.S. successfully.

The Intensive English Program (or IEP), launched in September, is an add-on to their current English as a Second Language Program (or ESL). Both programs provide *free, online, and customized lessons* to help international nurses improve their English communication skills.

The global demand for healthcare professionals continues to increase, especially after the pandemic. Working internationally for nurses is becoming more and more appealing and accessible due to a wider range of benefits, immigration assistance programs, and hospital’s acceptance of foreign workers. We, at Flint, recognize the urgent demand from both ends—the U.S. hospitals experiencing staff shortages and the international nurses wanting to improve their status.

We want to help qualified international nurses overcome financial difficulties and language barriers. Currently, nurses are having a hard time immigrating to the U.S. due to their low English communication skills. Flint’s newest program, the EIP, will help international nurses improve their English proficiency and is offered entirely online to improve accessibility.

## Flint’s Promise

Guided by our values and mission to help international nurses to fulfill their dreams, Flint commits to selecting and training qualified nurses via an all-inclusive program. From the beginning until the end of the process, we will assist, guide, educate, support, and prepare international nurses for the best placement opportunities and long-term career success in the U.S.

Flint commits to opening the pathway for your integration into a borderless world and a progressive future! For nurses planning their new future in the U.S, apply at [withflint.com](https://withflint.com/nurse-careers/)
