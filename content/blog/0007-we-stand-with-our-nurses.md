We stand with our Nurses!
Flint partners with American health care providers to make employment possible. Without this connection it is too difficult to directly secure a position with a health provider. Our team at Flint has all experienced the challenge of not having the right connections to secure a new opportunity.

## The Problem

To relocate to America, nurses need to pass the NCLEX, demonstrate a professional level of English, and file for a nurse license and immigration. This requires an employment offer. It is difficult to complete these tasks while working full-time, or often 2 jobs, and supporting a family. Furthermore, the relocation costs require an investment that could take 10 years to save. This creates significant inequality in terms of opportunity for nurses worldwide that dream of moving to the United States. We stand with our nurses and create the necessary partnerships, financing, flexibility, support, and education required!

## Partnerships

Flint partners with American health care providers to make employment possible. Without this connection it is too difficult to directly secure a position with a health provider. Our team at Flint has all experienced the challenge of not having the right connections to secure a new opportunity. We donâ€™t want this to be the case for our nurses!

## Financing

We have created a scholarship program for eligible nurses. By bringing financial support to these nurses, we give them an [equal opportunity](https://www.notion.so/Built-on-Human-Rights-ab6b80c0201540a79e48175a42cd68bf)! This means the most qualified nurses get to the front of the line and every nurse has a chance to dream.

We also do not put a heavy financial fine on our nurses if they are unsuccessful. We have seen individuals who have worked with reputable firms and been required to pay over $100,000 due to them being unable to pass the NCLEX. We take on the financial responsibility for the nurses, and we mitigate our risk by doing a full screening ahead of time before we commit to working together.

## Flexibility

We offer something that no others prioritizes - flexibility for the nurses. We give the nurse choice:

- What state do you want to work in?
- What type of unit are you best suited for?
- Do you want to work at this specific hospital?

These seem like basic questions, but most people ignore them.

## Support

Everyone needs support! The process of moving your life has many details outside of work. We partner with our nurses to help bring their loved ones and create more stability during an unstable time.

## Education

To be successful, the nurses need not only to prepare for the English and NCLEX examination but also must integrate into the American way of nursing. That is why Flint focuses on education and why we offer scholarships to nurses so that they can take the time to learn while keeping their commitment to their families. Our education program includes NCLEX training, learning about American nursing, and how nursing teams work together in America. Modules focus on etiquette, industry jargon, and local tradition.
