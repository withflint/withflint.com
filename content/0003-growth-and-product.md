How Flint Thinks about Growth & Product
Growth and a great product are two of the most important areas every startup needs to focus on. In many ways these two priorities are intertwined. You can’t have growth without a great product, and a great product without growth doesn’t matter because nobody is using it.

Growth and a great product are two of the most important areas every startup needs to focus on. In many ways these two priorities are intertwined. You can’t have growth without a great product, and a great product without growth doesn’t matter because nobody is using it. So how we think about this is critical. After recently having a handful of conversations on this topic, I decided to put these thoughts into writing to provide visibility for the whole Flint community.

## So what do we mean when we say growth?

We mean growth that builds a multi-billion dollar company in under 5 years. Growth like the ‘[Triple, Triple, Double, Double, Double](https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/01/the-saas-travel-adventure/)’ rate that Neeraj promoted. Growth that supports venture backed returns. When we talk about growth we are talking about outlier growth.

## What do we mean when we say a great product?

We mean a product that creates tangible, no brainer value for a group of people (customers). A product that solves a small or big problem, but the total addressable value is immense (ie. big TAM). A simple product that’s scalable to meet our growth goals. To build a great product, we need a process that puts business outcomes before less powerful outputs ([a nod to Marty Cagan](https://svpg.com/focus-on-value/)).

## Okay, but which one is more important?

This is a key question. Are you going to be product or growth led? In our last company, Oco Meals (a meal prep platform), we prioritized growth at all costs. Every week we had a target to grow 5% (we pulled this from [Jim Collins’ 20 mile march principle](https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/twenty-mile-march.html)). Consistent growth was our North Star, and we grew 30% month on month! But when we hit $2M in sales, growth became more challenging. At this point, we did not have a strong product vision, but we had a very strong growth vision. Our product was good but many elements would need substantial effort to bring it to great. To top it off, we didn’t fully grasp who our core customer was, and there was a lack of no brainer value in our product.

The lesson we learned was without a great product, growth will not be sustained to match our growth philosophy. So after a deep dive into these problems our team concluded that we were not the right people to deliver value for a consumer food product. We were a team of engineers who were more concerned about cost and convenience than taste and experience. So we pivoted. Selling the business and diving into Flint.

## So what changed?

With Flint, we made the decision to shift from a growth led organization to a product led organization. Forming our own discovery framework inspired by people like Anthony Ulwick (Jobs to be Done) and Dan Olsen (Lean Product Playbook), we gradually de-risked the value hypothesis. We took four months of dedicated time doing customer discovery, and we spoke with over 100 chefs across North America to ensure a real sample size for true value creation. Though we wanted to drive growth from day one, we paused to make sure that we would create tangible value. We let the product dictate our speed, not our growth goals. It worked! We launched Flint with great success, doubling month on month, and had true customer pull. [We had built something people wanted!](http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html)

This approach was very different from what our team had done in the past. It took a lot of discipline to not run ahead and start growing ideas that were not ready, but these lessons shaped how all of us at Flint think about growth and product. We believe that through disciplined discovery and a great product comes outlier growth. We know there will be many trade offs on the path to building a multi-billion dollar organization, but we hope that this glimpse into how we think about product and growth let’s you get to know the Flint team more.
