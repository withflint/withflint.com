## About Flint

Flint is on a mission to fix American Healthcare by solving their biggest problem: not enough nurses. We do this by removing barriers for international nurses to immigrate and build a career in the United States, and we are on track to help a 1,000+ nurses immigrate by the end of next year (2023).

We’re a Y Combinator tech startup, with over $10M raised, and backed by Tier 1 investors such as Haystack, Audacious, and a list of powerful angels from company greats like Airbnb, Twitch and Flexport. Our team is fully remote across multiple countries, and comprised of industry veterans from technology, healthcare, and immigration.

We’re on track to raise our series A in the next 3-6 months. If you want an early equity stake in a 🚀 rocketship company, now is the time to join.
