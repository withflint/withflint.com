## About the Position

The nursing shortages in the US have been highlighted by Covid-19 with little sign of improvement. To be a part of the solution, Flint is dedicated to streamlining the nursing licensing hurdles for internationally-educated nurses. We are looking for someone to help advise our team as we assist nurses abroad to pass the NCLEX and coach them through the process of becoming a Registered Nurse in the United States.

### As Flint’s Nursing Educator, you will:

- Create and update an NCLEX course for Flint’s nurses
- Interview nurses for admission to the NCLEX course
- Coach and mentor the nurses taking Flint’s NCLEX course
- Advise Flint in matters of American nursing and education
- Train Flint in understanding the world of healthcare and nursing
- Develop future courses beyond NCLEX

## About You

*You are a forward-thinker.* As a nurse, the job can feel like you’re just clocking in and clocking out. We are looking for someone who wants to make an impact beyond a 12-hour shift and contribute to systemic changes.

*You are passionate about education.* Passing the NCLEX is no easy task. We are looking for someone who can make our nurses’ NCLEX journeys smooth and comprehensive.

*You are curious and adaptable.* The start-up world is a lot different from clinical settings. We are looking for someone willing to learn the ins and outs of the business start-up world and contribute their nursing expertise while doing it.

*You value nurses from diverse spaces.* When you become a nurse, you become part of an international community of health advocates and leaders. You care about every nurses’ right to move and seek opportunities in new places.
