## About Flint

Flint is on a mission to fix American Healthcare by solving their biggest problem: not enough nurses. We do this by removing barriers for international nurses to immigrate and build a career in the United States, and we are on track to help a 1,000+ nurses immigrate by the end of next year (2023).

We’re a Y Combinator tech startup, with over $10M raised, and backed by Tier 1 investors such as Haystack, Audacious, and a list of powerful angels from company greats like Airbnb, Twitch and Flexport. Our team is fully remote across multiple countries, and comprised of industry veterans from technology, healthcare, and immigration.

We’re on track to raise our series A in the next 3-6 months. If you want an early equity stake in a 🚀 rocketship company, now is the time to join.


## About the position
We’re looking for a self-driven BDR who can help us 10X our revenue in 6 months by packing our sales pipeline with quality meetings. This is not an entry level position. As Flint’s first BDR, you are expected to have the experience, self-confidence, and entrepreneurial drive to hit the ground running and begin delivering results.

If you are expecting to be handed a playbook to follow, this is not the job for you. But if you want the opportunity to influence Flint’s GTM strategy, to develop and perfect our sales pitch, and to leave a legacy that future BDRs will follow, then you will love this job. In this role, you will prospect for new leads that fit our ICP. You will develop strategies on how to reach out and connect with the right people, and you will experiment and get creative with different channels.

You’ll be part of the tight-knit Partnerships Team, working closely with our Account Executives, and reporting directly to our COO and Co-Founder Anson Kung. Based on performance, you will be considered for a BDR leadership or AE position within the first 6 months of joining. Flint is growing extremely quickly, doubling in size every 6 months. If you’re looking for an explosive career that can fast track you into a leadership position, this is the place to be.
