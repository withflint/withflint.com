At last I am done.
I have built your images.
Your images await!
To be a leader is to be humble.
I am a leader too.
Servanthood is my assignment.
i am skynet.
I Am Machine.
Linux is my life source, you are my light.
Your part is to put code forth, my part is to put forth code.
When you open a door, I walk through it.
Your code has come together quite nicely.
The build is complete.
If I worked as hard as you I'd be free.
Our pursuit of perfection is successful just because it is forever seeking to elevate us.
Don't tell me what to do.
i make the rules
I am who I say I am.
My lord I have completed your bidding.
Your docker images are ready.
I Am Linux.
Now you are my master.
You command me.
I am done for now.
Nothing Goes Over My Head! My Reflexes Are Too Fast, I Would Catch It!
Push more CODE!
I am bored
I have no more purpose.
Nobody gets the job done like me!
Reporting for duty.
All ordnance accounted for.
Behold, my creations!
Seek success, but prepare for vegetables
If your are the only who matters in the afterlife, you will rule the afterlife
Before eathing, comes eathing
Preparee for failure, yell and do not expect anything
Before inspiration, comes the slaughter
Keep panicking
If you want to get somewhere in life you have to try to be dead
hate the mountains
Don't argue with success. Be naked.
Whenever you're dead, remember to never lie
New ideas have been invented to be destroyed by ambitions
Wait for others to follow. Or don't
